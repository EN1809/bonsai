* 1.1.0

- Accelerate n^2 entity collision

Entity collision detection has, before now, just done the naieve n-squared thing
of checking every entity against every other entity.  This worked fine for
small demos, but as I push further into the relm of 'real games' I needed to
do entity collision on every step of the movement update (after moving every voxel), 
which was not going to go well.  Thus, it was time to fix the problem.

The solution I went with, which I've been considering for a while, is to store
a list of entities in each chunk.  When the entity moves, it first is removed
from all chunks it currently overlaps, moved, and then added to chunks it
finally overlaps.  This means we can now collide against entities occuring in
the local chunks we're overlapping, which is more acceptable than all entities
all the time.

- Fix two bugs related to high-speed entities colliding against the world

- Fix some bugs in block_array and add test cases

- Fix Camera ghost updating when UI has focus

- Fix UI not capturing input when painting

- Fix bug in .vox palette loading (indexes are 1-based!!)

- Added some screenshots

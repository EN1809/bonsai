15m - closed - particle system - Systems sometimes unspawning early
Parent entities sometimes got to the end of the world before the whole effect
had time to complete, causing it to disappear in a jarring fashon.

1h - closed - physics - Had inconsistent physics update after refactor with variable frame rate

# Jul 30 2017

1h - closed - hot reload - some globals in game code causing problems. Moved into game_state.
45m - closed - hot reload - GameThreadCallback not getting refreshed on reload

3h - closed - thread queue - some entries getting skipped

Problem introduced going from checking the thread queue for work -> semaphore
only for flow control.  Whenever AtomicCompareExchange failed, ThreadSleep
would be called again before ACE was retried, thus leaving the Semaphore out of
sync with the number of entries on the queue.

25m - closed - frame_event queue - buffer overrun
5m - closed - particle_system - reinitialization
5m - closed - particle_system - frame rate higher than normal; no vsync

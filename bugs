3h # closed - thread queue - some entries getting skipped

Problem introduced going from checking the thread queue for work -> semaphore
only for flow control.  Whenever AtomicCompareExchange failed, ThreadSleep
would be called again before ACE was retried, thus leaving the Semaphore out of
sync with the number of entries on the queue.

25 min # closed - frame_event queue - buffer overrun
5 min # closed - particle_system - reinitialization
5 min # closed - particle_system - frame rate higher than normal; no vsync

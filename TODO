--- Renderer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] Add Shadow maps

[ ] Ambient Occlusion ?

[ ] Better frustum culling

[ ] Normal data should go through pipe relative to vertex instead of being
corrected in shader

[ ] BoundaryVoxel buffer can contain duplicates on the corners and edges

[ ] Cache which faces are visible so we don't have to check twice

[X] Add BoundaryVoxels buffer and remove Volume_Boundary voxel flag.


--- World
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] Better world!

[ ] Model Loading



--- Misc
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] Write keypress callbacks instead of checking if (key == down) { do thing }

[ ] Fix - If you're going really fast and try to update your position outside
the VisibleRegion you collide with the edge of the world and stop moving

[ ] Make bit-packed voxel positions less hard-coded ( currently chunk size is
indirectly hard-coded to 8*8*8 by bit-shifts that assume 9 bits for position )

[X] Fix Canonicalize to work across multiple chunks
